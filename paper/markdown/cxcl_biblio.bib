abstract = {Cancer cells can inhibit effector T cells (Teff) through both immunomodulatory receptors and the impact of cancer metabolism on the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, Teff require high rates of glucose metabolism, and consumption of essential nutrients or generation of waste products by tumor cells may impede essential T cell metabolic pathways. Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is characterized by loss of the tumor suppressor von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) and altered cancer cell metabolism. Here, we assessed how ccRCC influences the metabolism and activation of primary patient ccRCC tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). CD8 TIL were abundant in ccRCC, but they were phenotypically distinct and both functionally and metabolically impaired. ccRCC CD8 TIL were unable to efficiently uptake glucose or perform glycolysis and had small, fragmented mitochondria that were hyperpolarized and generated large amounts of ROS. Elevated ROS was associated with downregulated mitochondrial SOD2. CD8 T cells with hyperpolarized mitochondria were also visible in the blood of ccRCC patients. Importantly, provision of pyruvate to bypass glycolytic defects or scavengers to neutralize mitochondrial ROS could partially restore TIL activation. Thus, strategies to improve metabolic function of ccRCC CD8 TIL may promote the immune response to ccRCC.},

abstract = {Stimulated CD4+ T lymphocytes can differentiate into effector T cell (Teff) or inducible regulatory T cell (Treg) subsets with specific immunological roles. We show that Teff and Treg require distinct metabolic programs to support these functions. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells expressed high surface levels of the glucose transporter Glut1 and were highly glycolytic. Treg, in contrast, expressed low levels of Glut1 and had high lipid oxidation rates. Consistent with glycolysis and lipid oxidation promoting Teff and Treg, respectively, Teff were selectively increased in Glut1 transgenic mice and reliant on glucose metabolism, whereas Treg had activated AMP-activated protein kinase and were dependent on lipid oxidation. Importantly, AMP-activated protein kinase stimulation was sufficient to decrease Glut1 and increase Treg generation in an asthma model. These data demonstrate that CD4+ T cell subsets require distinct metabolic programs that can be manipulated in vivo to control Treg and Teff development in inflammatory diseases.},

Fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) are a family of lipid chaperones required to facilitate uptake and intracellular lipid trafficking. One family member, FABP5, is expressed in T cells, but its function remains unclear. We show that in Tregs, genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of FABP5 function causes mitochondrial changes underscored by decreased OXPHOS, impaired lipid metabolism, and loss of cristae structure. FABP5 inhibition in Tregs triggers mtDNA release and consequent cGAS-STING-dependent type I IFN signaling, which induces heightened production of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 and promotes Treg suppressive activity. We find evidence of this pathway, along with correlative mitochondrial changes in tumor infiltrating Tregs, which may underlie enhanced immunosuppression in the tumor microenvironment. Together, our data reveal that FABP5 is a gatekeeper of mitochondrial integrity that modulates Treg function.},

A crucial contribution of serine/glycine to cellular metabolism is through the glycine cleavage system, which refuels one-carbon metabolism; a complex cyclic metabolic network based on chemical reactions of folate compounds. The importance of serine/glycine metabolism is further highlighted by genetic and functional evidence indicating that hyperactivation of the serine/glycine biosynthetic pathway drives oncogenesis.

abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is histologically defined by its lipid and glycogen-rich cytoplasmic deposits. Alterations in the VHL tumor suppressor stabilizing the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are the most prevalent molecular features of clear cell tumors. The significance of lipid deposition remains undefined. We describe the mechanism of lipid deposition in ccRCC by identifying the rate-limiting component of mitochondrial fatty acid transport, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), as a direct HIF target gene. CPT1A is repressed by HIF1 and HIF2, reducing fatty acid transport into the mitochondria, and forcing fatty acids to lipid droplets for storage. Droplet formation occurs independent of lipid source, but only when CPT1A is repressed. Functionally, repression of CPT1A is critical for tumor formation, as elevated CPT1A expression limits tumor growth. In human tumors, CPT1A expression and activity are decreased versus normal kidney; and poor patient outcome associates with lower expression of CPT1A in tumors in TCGA. Together, our studies identify HIF control of fatty acid metabolism as essential for ccRCC tumorigenesis. Clear cell renal cancers (ccRCC) display elevated intracellular lipid storage. Here the authors show that such lipid accumulation is due to the repression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A) enzyme that impairs fatty acid (FA) transport into the mitochondrion resulting in reduced FA beta oxidation.},

abstract = {Predicting the distribution of metabolic fluxes in biochemical networks is of major interest in systems biology. Several databases provide metabolic reconstructions for different organisms. Software to analyze flux distributions exists, among others for the proprietary MATLAB environment. Given the large user community for the R computing environment, a simple implementation of flux analysis in R appears desirable and will facilitate easy interaction with computational tools to handle gene expression data. We extended the R software package BiGGR, an implementation of metabolic flux analysis in R. BiGGR makes use of public metabolic reconstruction databases, and contains the BiGG database and the reconstruction of human metabolism Recon2 as Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) objects. Models can be assembled by querying the databases for pathways, genes or reactions of interest. Fluxes can then be estimated by maximization or minimization of an objective function using linear inverse modeling algorithms. Furthermore, BiGGR provides functionality to quantify the uncertainty in flux estimates by sampling the constrained multidimensional flux space. As a result, ensembles of possible flux configurations are constructed that agree with measured data within precision limits. BiGGR also features automatic visualization of selected parts of metabolic networks using hypergraphs, with hyperedge widths proportional to estimated flux values. BiGGR supports import and export of models encoded in SBML and is therefore interoperable with different modeling and analysis tools. As an application example, we calculated the flux distribution in healthy human brain using a model of central carbon metabolism. We introduce a new algorithm termed Least-squares with equalities and inequalities Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA) to predict flux changes from gene expression changes, for instance during disease. Our estimates of brain metabolic flux pattern with Lsei-FBA for Alzheimer's disease agree with independent measurements of cerebral metabolism in patients. This second version of BiGGR is available from Bioconductor.},

Although conventional genomic markers (such as tumor mutation burden and neoantigen load) and the degree of CD8+ T cell infiltration were not associated with clinical response, we discovered numerous chromosomal alterations associated with response or resistance to PD-1 blockade. These advanced ccRCC tumors were highly CD8+ T cell infiltrated, with only 27% having a non-infiltrated phenotype. Our analysis revealed that infiltrated tumors are depleted of favorable PBRM1 mutations and enriched for unfavorable chromosomal losses of 9p21.3, as compared with non-infiltrated tumors, demonstrating how the potential interplay of immunophenotypes with somatic alterations impacts therapeutic efficacy.},

In this study, we utilized this model and genome-wide transcriptomic analysis to examine changes in gene expression in aged na{\"{i}}ve and memory T cell populations during the aging process. We identified profound gene alterations in aged CD4 and CD8 T cells. Both aged CD4+ and CD8+ na{\"{i}}ve T cells showed significantly decreased organelle function. Importantly, genes associated with lymphocyte activation and function demonstrated a significant increase in aged memory T cells, accompanied by upregulation of immunosuppressive markers and immune checkpoints, revealing an abnormal T cell function in aged cells. Furthermore, aging significantly affects T cell survival and death signaling. While aged CD4 memory T cells exhibited pro-apoptotic gene signatures, aged CD8 memory T cells expressed anti-apoptotic genes. Thus, the transcriptional analysis of gene expression and signaling pathways in aged T cell subsets shed light on our understanding of altered immune function with aging, which will have great potential for clinical interventions for older adults.},

Here, we show how immunedeconv can be installed and applied to a typical dataset. First, we give an example for obtaining cell-type fractions using quanTIseq. Second, we show how dimensionless scores produced by MCP-counter can be used for cross-sample comparisons. For each of these examples, we provide R code illustrating how immunedeconv results can be summarized graphically.},

abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in cancer incidence and outcome is widespread. Understanding the underlying mechanisms is fundamental to improve cancer prevention and clinical management. Sex disparities are particularly striking in kidney cancer: Across diverse populations, men consistently show unexplained 2-fold increased incidence and worse prognosis. We have characterized genome-wide expression and regulatory networks of 609 renal tumors and 256 non-tumor renal tissues. Normal kidney displayed sex-specific transcriptional signatures, including higher expression of X-linked tumor suppressor genes in women. Sex-dependent genotype-phenotype associations unraveled women-specific immune regulation. Sex differences were markedly expanded in tumors, with male-biased expression of key genes implicated in metabolism, non-malignant diseases with male predominance and carcinogenesis, including markers of tumor infiltrating leukocytes. Analysis of sex-dependent RCC progression and survival uncovered prognostic markers involved in immune response and oxygen homeostasis. In summary, human kidney tissues display remarkable sexual dimorphism at the molecular level. Sex-specific transcriptional signatures further shape renal cancer, with relevance for clinical management.},

abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) has been previously classified into putative discrete prognostic subtypes by gene expression profiling. To investigate the robustness of these proposed subtype classifications, we evaluated 12 public datasets, together with a new dataset of 265 ccRCC gene expression profiles. Consensus clustering showed unstable subtype and principal component analysis (PCA) showed a continuous spectrum both within and between datasets. Considering the lack of discrete delineation and continuous spectrum observed, we developed a continuous quantitative prognosis score (Continuous Linear Enhanced Assessment of RCC, or CLEAR score). Prognostic performance was evaluated in independent cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 414) and EMBL-EBI (n = 53), CLEAR score demonstrated both superior prognostic estimates and inverse correlation with anti-Angiogenic tyrosine-kinase inhibition in comparison to previously proposed discrete subtyping classifications. Inverse correlation with high-dose interleukin-2 outcomes was also observed for the CLEAR score. Multiple somatic mutations (VHL, PBRM1, SETD2, KDM5C, TP53, BAP1, PTEN, MTOR) were associated with the CLEAR score. Application of the CLEAR score to independent expression profiling of intratumoral ccRCC regions demonstrated that average intertumoral heterogeneity exceeded intratumoral expression heterogeneity. Wider investigation of cancer biology using continuous approaches may yield insights into tumor heterogeneity; single cell analysis may provide a key foundation for this approach.},

abstract = {Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10. Remodelling cellular metabolism thus constitutes a recurrent pattern in ccRCC that correlates with tumour stage and severity and offers new views on the opportunities for disease treatment. The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network reports an integrative analysis of more than 400 samples of clear cell renal cell carcinoma based on genomic, DNA methylation, RNA and proteomic characterisation; frequent mutations were identified in the PI(3)K/AKT pathway, suggesting this pathway might be a potential therapeutic target, among the findings is also a demonstration of metabolic remodelling which correlates with tumour stage and severity. The Cancer Genome Atlas consortium reports an integrative analysis of more than 400 samples of clear cell renal carcinoma on the basis of genomic, DNA methylation, RNA and proteomic characterization. The data reveal frequent mutations in the PI(3)K/AKT pathway, suggesting that this pathway might be a potential therapeutic target, in addition to an array of epigenetic alterations that are linked to specific mutations in chromatin-associated proteins. One notable finding is the presence of a metabolic shift in aggressive cancers, correlating with tumour stage and severity.},

Advances in single-cell technologies have enabled high-resolution dissection of tissue composition. Several tools for dimensionality reduction are available to analyze the large number of parameters generated in single-cell studies. Recently, a nonlinear dimensionality-reduction technique, uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP), was developed for the analysis of any type of high-dimensional data. Here we apply it to biological data, using three well-characterized mass cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. Comparing the performance of UMAP with five other tools, we find that UMAP provides the fastest run times, highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters. The work highlights the use of UMAP for improved visualization and interpretation of single-cell data.},

abstract = {Data clustering describes a set of frequently employed techniques in exploratory data analysis to extract "natural" group structure in data. Such groupings need to be validated to separate the signal in the data from spurious structure. In this context, finding an appropriate number of clusters is a particularly important model selection question. We introduce a measure of cluster stability to assess the validity of a cluster model. This stability measure quantifies the reproducibility of clustering solutions on a second sample, and it can be interpreted as a classification risk with regard to class labels produced by a clustering algorithm. The preferred number of clusters is determined by minimizing this classification risk as a function of the number of clusters. Convincing results are achieved on simulated as well as gene expression data sets. Comparisons to other methods demonstrate the competitive performance of our method and its suitability as a general validation tool for clustering solutions in real-world problems.},

But the limited labeled data may be imbalanced and can not cover all clusters in some cases and most of the existing semi-supervised clustering algorithms can not deal with imbalanced dataset well and have no the ability of detecting new clusters. In view of this, an adaptive semi-supervised clustering algorithm with label propagation is proposed. Two most of interesting characteristics of the proposed algorithm are that (1) It uses the limited labeled data to expand labeled dataset based on an adaptive threshold by labeling their k-nearest neighbors, (2) It detects whether there exist new clusters in the unlabeled dataset according to a proposed measure criterion. Three standard datasets are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the experimental results confirm that the accuracy of the proposed clustering algorithm is much higher than that of three compared algorithm and in addition the proposed algorithm has the ability of detecting new clusters. {\textcopyright} 2014 Academic Journals Inc.},

Feasibility is demonstrated by validation with flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and single-cell RNA-Seq analyses of human melanoma and colorectal tumor specimens.

abstract = {Motivation: The composition and density of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) profoundly influence tumor progression and success of anti-cancer therapies. Flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry staining or single-cell sequencing are often unavailable such that we rely on computational methods to estimate the immune-cell composition from bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Various methods have been proposed recently, yet their capabilities and limitations have not been evaluated systematically. A general guideline leading the research community through cell type deconvolution is missing. Results: We developed a systematic approach for benchmarking such computational methods and assessed the accuracy of tools at estimating nine different immune- and stromal cells from bulk RNA-seq samples. We used a single-cell RNA-seq dataset of ∼11 000 cells from the TME to simulate bulk samples of known cell type proportions, and validated the results using independent, publicly available gold-standard estimates. This allowed us to analyze and condense the results of more than a hundred thousand predictions to provide an exhaustive evaluation across seven computational methods over nine cell types and ∼1800 samples from five simulated and real-world datasets. We demonstrate that computational deconvolution performs at high accuracy for well-defined cell-type signatures and propose how fuzzy cell-type signatures can be improved. We suggest that future efforts should be dedicated to refining cell population definitions and finding reliable signatures.},

abstract = {Tumor progression and the efficacy of immunotherapy are strongly influenced by the composition and abundance of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment. Due to the limitations of direct measurement methods, computational algorithms are often used to infer immune cell composition from bulk tumor transcriptome profiles. These estimated tumor immune infiltrate populations have been associated with genomic and transcriptomic changes in the tumors, providing insight into tumor-immune interactions. However, such investigations on large-scale public data remain challenging. To lower the barriers for the analysis of complex tumor-immune interactions, we significantly improved our previous web platform TIMER. Instead of just using one algorithm, TIMER2.0 (http://timer.cistrome.org/) provides more robust estimation of immune infiltration levels for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) or user-provided tumor profiles using six state-of-the-art algorithms. TIMER2.0 provides four modules for investigating the associations between immune infiltrates and genetic or clinical features, and four modules for exploring cancer-related associations in the TCGA cohorts. Each module can generate a functional heatmap table, enabling the user to easily identify significant associations in multiple cancer types simultaneously. Overall, the TIMER2.0 web server provides comprehensive analysis and visualization functions of tumor infiltrating immune cells.},

The two-stage procedure-first using SOM to produce the prototypes that are then clustered in the second stage-is found to perform well when compared with direct clustering of the data and to reduce the computation time.},

abstract = {Background: The tumor-microenvironment (TME) represents an attractive therapeutic target in NSCLC and plays an important role for efficacy of cancer therapeutics. We hypothesized that upregulation of collagen synthesis might be associated with adverse outcome in NSCLC. Literature evidence suggests that renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASi) decrease collagen deposition. Therefore, we aimed to explore the prognostic role of RASi intake and their influence on the TME in NSCLC. Methods: Four publicly available datasets were used to evaluate the impact of key enzymes involved in collagen biosynthesis. To investigate the influence of RASi intake on the TME and prognosis we evaluated a cohort of metastatic NSCLC patients and performed histopathological characterization of the TME. A three-dimensional microtissue in vitro model was developed to define the impact of RASi on collagen synthesis. Results: Expression of three genes of the collagen synthesis pathway, ALDH18A1, PLOD2 and P4HA1, was upregulated in NSCLC compared to normal lung tissue and linked to shortened overall survival in all investigated cohorts. Together, these genes formed a 'Collagen Signature' which represents an independent unfavourable prognostic factor in two NSCLC cohorts and was linked to alterations of the extracellular matrix deposition and cell cycle pathways. In the cohort of metastatic NSCLC, RASi intake was linked to improved overall response rate and survival. Exploratory in vitro experiments revealed that RASi led to a dose dependent reduction of collagen deposition and degradation of three-dimensional lung cancer cell spheroids. Conclusion: We demonstrate that collagen synthesis is a key upregulated process in the NSCLC TME and its transcriptional readout, the three gene Collagen Signature is independently associated with poor outcome. Pharmacological targeting of this pathways e.g. by RASi bears potential of improving outcome in NSCLC.},

In general, the use of meta-analysis has been increasing over the last three decades with mental health as a major research topic. It is then essential to well understand its methodology and interpret its results. In this publication, we describe how to perform a meta-analysis with the freely available statistical software environment R, using a working example taken from the field of mental health. Methods R package meta is used to conduct standard meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses for missing binary outcome data and potential selection bias are conducted with R package metasens. All essential R commands are provided and clearly described to conduct and report analyses. Results The working example considers a binary outcome: we show how to conduct a fixed effect and random effects meta-analysis and subgroup analysis, produce a forest and funnel plot and to test and adjust for funnel plot asymmetry. All these steps work similar for other outcome types. Conclusions R represents a powerful and flexible tool to conduct meta-analyses. This publication gives a brief glimpse into the topic and provides directions to more advanced meta-analysis methods available in R.},

abstract = {Clustering non-Euclidean data is difficult, and one of the most used algorithms besides hierarchical clustering is the popular algorithm Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids. In Euclidean geometry the mean—as used in k-means—is a good estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the second (“SWAP”) phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as the original PAM algorithm. If we slightly relax the choice of swaps performed (while retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by performing up to k swaps in each iteration. With the substantially faster SWAP, we can now explore faster intialization strategies. We also show how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.},

@article{Tarca2009,
abstract = {Motivation: Gene expression class comparison studies may identify hundreds or thousands of genes as differentially expressed (DE) between sample groups. Gaining biological insight from the result of such experiments can be approached, for instance, by identifying the signaling pathways impacted by the observed changes. Most of the existing pathway analysis methods focus on either the number of DE genes observed in a given pathway (enrichment analysis methods), or on the correlation between the pathway genes and the class of the samples (functional class scoring methods). Both approaches treat the pathways as simple sets of genes, disregarding the complex gene interactions that these pathways are built to describe. Results: We describe a novel signaling pathway impact analysis (SPIA) that combines the evidence obtained from the classical enrichment analysis with a novel type of evidence, which measures the actual perturbation on a given pathway under a given condition. A bootstrap procedure is used to assess the significance of the observed total pathway perturbation. Using simulations we show that the evidence derived from perturbations is independent of the pathway enrichment evidence. This allows us to calculate a global pathway significance P-value, which combines the enrichment and perturbation P-values. We illustrate the capabilities of the novel method on four real datasets. The results obtained on these data show that SPIA has better specificity and more sensitivity than several widely used pathway analysis methods. {\textcopyright} The Author 2008.

abstract = {Background: Gene set enrichment (GSE) analysis is a popular framework for condensing information from gene expression profiles into a pathway or signature summary. The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets. Results: To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments. Conclusions: GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

abstract = {Comparison is a fundamental method of scientific research leading to insights about the processes that generate similarity or dissimilarity. In statistical terms comparisons between probability functions are performed to infer connections, correlations, or relationships between objects or samples (Cha 2007). Most quantification methods rely on distance or similarity measures, but the right choice for each individual application is not always clear and sometimes poorly explored. The reason for this is partly that diverse measures are either implemented in different R packages with very different notations or are not implemented at all. Thus, a comprehensive framework implementing the most common similarity and distance measures using a uniform notation is still missing. The R (R Core Team 2018) package Philentropy aims to fill this gap by implementing forty-six fundamental distance and similarity measures (Cha 2007) for comparing probability functions. These comparisons between probability functions have their foundations in a broad range of scientific disciplines from mathematics to ecology. The aim of this package is to provide a comprehensive and computationally optimized base framework for clustering, classification, statistical inference, goodness-of-fit, non-parametric statistics, information theory, and machine learning tasks that are based on comparing univariate or multivari-ate probability functions. All functions are written in C++ and are integrated into the R package using the Rcpp Application Programming Interface (API) (Eddelbuettel 2013). Together, this framework allows building new similarity or distance based (statistical) models and algorithms in R which are computationally efficient and scalable. The comprehensive availability of diverse metrics and measures furthermore enables a systematic assessment of choosing the most optimal similarity or distance measure for individual applications in diverse scientific disciplines. The following probability distance/similarity and information theory measures are implemented in Philentropy.

The style and theme of these output formats can be customized. We used books and R primarily for examples in this book, but bookdown is not only for books or R. Most features introduced in this book also apply to other types of publications: journal papers, reports, dissertations, course handouts, study notes, and even novels. You do not have to use R, either. Other choices of computing languages include Python, C, C plus plus, SQL, Bash, Stan, JavaScript, and so on, although R is best supported.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses- the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial.

abstract = {Evidence has accumulated asserting the importance of cullin-RING (really interesting new gene) ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) and their regulator Cullin-associated neural-precursor-cell-expressed developmentally down-regulated 8 (NEDD8) dissociated protein 1 (Cand1) in various cancer entities. However, the role of Cand1 in prostate cancer (PCa) has not been intensively investigated so far. Thus, in the present study, we aimed to assess the relevance of Cand1 in the clinical and preclinical setting. Immunohistochemical analyses of radical prostatectomy specimens of PCa patients showed that Cand1 protein levels are elevated in PCa compared to benign areas. In addition, high Cand1 levels were associated with higher Gleason Scores, as well as higher tumor recurrence and decreased overall survival. In line with clinical findings, in vitro experiments in different PCa cell lines revealed that knockdown of Cand1 reduced cell viability and proliferation and increased apoptosis, therefore underlining its role in tumor progression. We also found that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 is significantly upregulated upon downregulation of Cand1. Using bioinformatic tools, we detected genes encoding for proteins linked to mRNA turnover, protein polyubiquitination, and proteasomal degradation to be significantly upregulated in Cand1high tumors. Next generation sequencing of PCa cell lines resistant to the anti-androgen enzalutamide revealed that Cand1 is mutated in enzalutamide-resistant cells, however, with little functional and clinically relevant impact in the process of resistance development. To summarize the present study, we found that high Cand1 levels correlate with PCa aggressiveness.},

Users only need to supply their data and specify the target pathway. Pathview automatically downloads the pathway graph data, parses the data file, maps and integrates user data onto the pathway and renders pathway graphs with the mapped data. Although built as a stand-alone program, Pathview may seamlessly integrate with pathway and functional analysis tools for large-scale and fully automated analysis pipelines. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author 2013.

abstract = {At a high level, the tidyverse is a language for solving data science challenges with R code. Its primary goal is to facilitate a conversation between a human and a computer about data. Less abstractly, the tidyverse is a collection of R packages that share a high-level design philosophy and low-level grammar and data structures, so that learning one package makes it easier to learn the next. The tidyverse encompasses the repeated tasks at the heart of every data science project: data import, tidying, manipulation, visualisation, and programming. We expect that almost every project will use multiple domain-specific packages outside of the tidyverse: our goal is to provide tooling for the most common challenges; not to solve every possible problem. Notably, the tidyverse doesn't include tools for statistical modelling or communication. These toolkits are critical for data science, but are so large that they merit separate treatment. The tidyverse package allows users to install all tidyverse packages with a single command. There are a number of projects that are similar in scope to the tidyverse. The closest is perhaps Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Huber et al., 2015), which provides an ecosystem of packages that support the analysis of high-throughput genomic data.},
